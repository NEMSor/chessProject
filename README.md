Things to note:

Pawns can be promoted, En Passant is a possible move that can be player, and Castles are also on the board.

White Pieces are at the top while the Black Pieces are at the bottom of the board. White goes first.

This chess game is "Touch Move" meaning that after you have selected a piece, you cannot change the piece.

After selecting a piece, enter an number and only a number, otherwise it will break.

There is an AI player that plays random moves. You can play it against itself or play against it.

There is nothing that checks for "Checks" or "Checkmate." It's up to you to notice whether or not you are in check or checkmate. 

The game will go on until one player wins or cannot make a move.

Have Fun!
